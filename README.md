# AutoHotKey

## HipChat Script
This is a compiled [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/ "AutoHotKey's Homepage") script that makes it easy to change HipChat status. Automatically switches back to active window.

Now also changes Teams status. Teams doesn't support messages with the status. Brackets indicate what will happen in Teams vs. what happens in HipChat.

+ Ctrl+F1 - Available
+ Ctrl+F2 - Do Not Disturb On Phone [Do Not Disturb]
+ Ctrl+F3 - Away Back ~{current time + 15 rounded **UP** to nearest 5 minutes} [Be Right Back]
+ Ctrl+F4 - Away PM Me [Be Right Back]
+ Ctrl+F5 - Away {prompt for message} [Away]
+ Ctrl+F6 - Do Not Disturb {prompt for message} [Do Not Disturb]

## Window Switching Script
Quick switching to commonly open windows

+ Ctrl+Shift+F1 - HipChat
+ Ctrl+Shift+F2 - Remote Desktop (must include "gm rdp" in title bar)
+ Ctrl+Shift+F3 - Outlook
+ Ctrl+Shift+F4 - slack
+ Ctrl+Shift+F5 - Firefox
+ Ctrl+Shift+F6 - GoToMeeting
+ Ctrl+Shift+F7 - Chrome
+ Ctrl+Shift+F8 - SOLIDWORKS
+ Ctrl+Shift+F9 - 3CX

On my keyboard, I have those programmed to (in order):
+ fn+h
+ fn+g
+ fn+o
+ fn+s
+ fn+f
+ fn+m
+ fn+c
+ fn+w
+ fn+3
