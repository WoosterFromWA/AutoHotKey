## GMSearch Script
This is a compiled [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/ "AutoHotKey's Homepage") script that makes it easy to search for a contact in GM.

Simply press CTRL+ALT+= to get a message box asking for the contact's name (same as you would in the search field in the upper left corner of GM). It will then do the search for you and return the results in GM.

Make sure to have GM running or you'll get an error message
